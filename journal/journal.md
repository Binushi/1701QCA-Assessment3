LED Technology at The Met Gala

https://medium.com/@harishpersad/led-technology-at-the-met-gala-cd610c729d22

![Image](RP1.jpg)

This is Zendaya’s MET Gala look. It is a Cinderella dress designed by Law Roach that incorporates an LED solution for fabric colour changing in a daylight red carpet setting. This project is related to mine as I am also creating clothing with led lights. Instead of responding to light levels I am creating a jacket that responds to sound.  My aim is to create a more accessible version and incorporate sound.

This project is a device that allows users to translate sound to light! This plug-and-play stomp box analyses audio in real-time & generates music visualizations for smart LED pixels. This is similar to my project as I its LED’s that responds to sound. My aim is to incorporate something similar in a denim jacket.

This project is a fun way to display the status of all of your machines, to ensure the printers keep printing! This build uses a Particle Photon for its IoT capabilities, and Adafruit NeoPixels. This is similar to my project as it is wearable LED’s and that is another form of wearable tec.

This project is a Iconic Levi’s Trucker jacket merges style with innovative Jacquard technology. Answer calls, play music, and take photos right from your sleeve. This is similar to my project as it is a jacket with technology embedded in it.

Sound Reactive Dress. Made with bespoke holographic leather and sound-reactive, animated electroluminescent panels, as the volume rises, the dress illuminates to create ‘visual music’. Rainbow Winters, 2009. This project is simmilar to mine as it fashon inspired by music.

[mashable] (https://mashable.com/2016/02/11/led-clothes/)

This source is an article on the future of LED clothes. The article talks about different designers that are incorporating LED’s into their clothing, and briefly talks about the process of make the clothing and how to works. This gave me some ideas on how I could do my project. For example, the article says many designers use silhouettes popular in street like oversized and minimal this not only helps the aesthetic value of the project it will also help to hide the Micro Bit. The article also reviews the clothing and highlights some flaws in the design. This shows me what to avoid doing. 


[howstuffworks] (https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/fabric-display4.htm)

This article is similar to the previous one. This article goes more in-depth with the process of creating the clothing. This gave me inspiration on how I could do that.

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPxFe_rETHA)
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guZJT_h2gP0)

the three video are tutorial on how to make sound and voice reactive LED’s using Arduino. Although this was made for thee Arduino, I could adapt it work with the micro bit.  These video helped me get an idea on how mine should work on the micro bit. The videos also helped me get an idea of the sound sensor and how to works.


[sparkfun] (https://invent.sparkfun.com/cwists/preview/2054x)

This is a project someone has done that incorporates LED’s into a cape using a micro bit. What I have taken from this article is how to incorporate the LED’s. They used Lilly Pad LED’s with conductive thread. 

[YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxvBVvBWh4I)

This video goes into detail on different sew able LED’s and wearable technology in general. What I took from this video was that Lilly Pad LED’s work really well for wearable LED’s. They are waterproof but can be a bit expensive. 

[wearabletutorials] (https://www.wearabletutorials.com/making_leds_sewable_for_wearables_conductive_thread/)
 
This article is about Making LED Lights Sewable for Wearables and Conductive Thread This article. This article will help me make the LED’s I have sewable into the jacket.


[osoyoo] (https://osoyoo.com/2018/09/17/micro-bit-lesson-using-the-sound-detection-sensor/)

This website showed me how to connect the Sound sensor to my micro bit and get it working it also showed a simple code I can use to test if it’s working.

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->
The Design intent for my project is to create a jacket that has a design on the back panel that incorporates LED's that resound to sound.

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->
The Design intent for my project is to create a jacket that has a design on the back panel that incorporates LED's that resound to sound.

### Design concept 1 ###
My first design concept is a soundboard. It would allow to people to record sound and then play and loop them. The soundboard would have laptop connectivity allowing you to save the beat you have made. The soundboard would have a strip going down the centre and would come with a series to sticks with different coatings. Some have a thinner coating producing a different sound then one with a thick coting.


### Design concept 2 ###
My second design concept is a hat that moves to ward sound. There would be little spikes around the brim of the Hat that move toward where the sound in coming from. There would be a two sensors one on each side of the hat.


### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->
The final design concept is to create jacket that can be warned two parties in clubs. The final design concept is a jacket with LED lights integrated into the back panel that reacts to music, this is done through a sound sensor that’s sticks out of the top of the back panel. This project is inspired by project called “Eye of the Storm, A Thunderstorm Dress. Created by Rainbow Winters X WCPC & NthDegree, this dress has lights in it that respond to the sounds of nature and looks like lightning.

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->
let strip = neopixel.create(DigitalPin.P0, 24, NeoPixelMode.RGB)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (pins.digitalReadPin(DigitalPin.P1) == 1) {
        strip.showRainbow(1, 360)
    } else {
        strip.showColor(neopixel.colors(NeoPixelColors.Black))
    }
})


## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
